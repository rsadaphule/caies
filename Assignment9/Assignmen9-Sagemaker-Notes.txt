Notes:
AWS Sagemaker is cloud hosted solution where one can author machine learning code to train, test , deploy and evaluate the model. In this assignment, I created my own sagemake studio and a new Jupyrer notebook. I used bank training dataset which consists of bank customers profile data . The goal was to predict how likely a customer would create a new Certificate Deposit.


I used XGboost algorithm t training the a supervised model. XGBoost is an ensemble of weak learners and it uses  gradient boosted trees to combine these weak learners in a smart way to create a robust prediction.


The notebook code first  downloads bank data and then splits into training and test data. It uses docker image of XGBoost container for later use in the deployment.
The code sets following hyeprparametrs of XGBoost algorithm
max_depth=5
eta=0.2
gamma=4
min_child_weight=6
subsample=0.8
silent=0
objective='binary:logistic'
num_round=100 


The code then uploads raining data to s3 and trains a XGBoost model. It takes about 3 minutes to trains the mcdel 
It then deploys model to ml.m4.xlarge instance and evaluates model performance
Overall Classification Rate: 89.5%
